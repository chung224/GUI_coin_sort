####In Part 01, we are tasked we creating a rudimentary script before building on this In part 02.

#part01 should have these key feaures:
    #A fixed configuration that has the option to be shown [features include max/min input and all currency conversions]
    # option to exclude certain coins
    # Option to use all coins in order of importance or use single coins
    # Use an API to convert GBP to USD and Malagasy currency

#The code is arguably larger than it needs to be at its most simpliest level. However, the emphasise we wanted to place here and in the future
#is quality assurance (QA). As a team, we identified anomalous scenarious by testing various inputs and used *While True* conditions to keep asking
# for the appropiate input Examples include:
    #if the user inputs 2.4, we round down and assume the user means 2.
    # If the user inputs say, letters, then keep asking for appropiate input and display error messages.
    #what if the user uses capital letters? we deal with itin our program.
    #For coin exclusions, if different numbers are pressed or certain keys pressed more than once, we handle this by using sets

#A brief description will be provided by each section followed by code comments
